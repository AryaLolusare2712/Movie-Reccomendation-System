# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System using Machine Learning

A content-based movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on user input using machine learning techniques.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project recommends movies similar to the one the user inputs. It uses content-based filtering and machine learning techniques (like cosine similarity on text vectors). The system is built using Python and includes:

- A **Jupyter Notebook** for data exploration and model training
- Python scripts (`app.py`, `main.py`) for backend logic
- A **frontend** (HTML/CSS/JS) interface (inside `frontend.zip`)
- A CSV dataset containing movie metadata
